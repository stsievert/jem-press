You want to create a simple website. You don't want to mess around with any
GUIs and look at [Octopress][octo], [Jekyll][jekyll] and other blog-sensitive
[site generators][site], but they're not right. You look at [jemdoc][jemdoc],
[harp][harp] and [wintersmith][winter], but they all seem too complex (though
jemdoc the least complex). You just want to write your content, have it look
decent and publish it. You don't want to mess around with themes or CSS files.

jem-press does just that. It takes content written with Markdown and
makes a static (and not blog-sensitive) website that looks something like
[this][jem-press-ex].

jem-press was inspired by [jemdoc][jemdoc] and [octopress][octo] (and
hence the name). The main differences are jem-press uses the popular Markdown
and requires no configuration: you just start writing content.

### Goals
* $\LaTeX$ equation support (through MathJax).
* Usability. jem-press takes content written in Markdown and publishes that
  content with a CSS file.
