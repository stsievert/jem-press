<p>You want to create a simple website. You don't want to mess around with any GUIs and look at <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and other blog-sensitive <a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">site generators</a>, but they're not right. You look at <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a>, <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start">harp</a> and <a href="http://wintersmith.io">wintersmith</a>, but they all seem too complex (though jemdoc the least complex). You just want to write your content, have it look decent by default and publish it. You don't want to mess around with themes or CSS files.</p>
<p>jem-press just does that. You write your content in Markdown, run <code>ruby update.rb</code> and boom. Your site is in <code>html</code>, completely formatted. Prime candidates seem to be simple and blog-free websites, such as academic websites.</p>
<p>jem-press is designed to be <em>easy.</em> Complexity and ease seem to opose each other. This site generator is designed for you to create a site with ease and to customize the site with almost equal ease to a small degree. If you're interested in drastically changing the site, jem-press is not for you.</p>
<p>If <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a> had a child, they would name it jem-press. It would combine the convince of jemdoc with the functionality of Octopress. The main differences are jem-press uses the popular Markdown and requires no configuration: you just start writing content. jemdoc uses a not-very-popular markup syntax and requires some initial setup. Octopress is easy to use but is blog aware and doesn't seem right for these simple website.</p>
